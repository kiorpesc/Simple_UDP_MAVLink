Simple_UDP_MAVLink
==================

A simple utility to move MAVLink messages from serial to UDP and from UDP to serial.

Currently only supports Python3, will backport soon (the issue is in how Serial data is returned).

This is a little resource-heavy right now (on a laptop i5, uses up to 30% processor).
